          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy playing various genres of games, such as action, adventure,
            role-playing, strategy, and simulation. Some of my favorite games
            are Dota 2, Path of Exile, Company of Heroes, and Call of Duty.
            Gaming is more than just a hobby for me; it is a way of expressing
            myself, learning new skills, and escaping from reality. I always
            look forward to discovering new games and sharing my experiences
            with other gamers. Gaming is a part of who I am and what I love.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p class="little_description">
            I love listening to music and playing guitar because they allow me
            to express my emotions, creativity, and personality. I enjoy
            listening to various genres of music, such as rock, pop, metal and
            classical. Some of my favorite artists are The Beatles, Ed Sheeran,
            Metallica, and Francisco Tarrega( the composer of "Gran Vals",
            famously known as "Nokia Tune"). I also love playing the guitar and
            learning new songs and techniques. I have been playing the guitar
            for fourteen years and I have improved a lot since I started. I was
            introduced to fingerstyle, and classical style of playing guitar by
            a friend of mine and have been hooked up to it since.
